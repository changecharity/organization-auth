The Change Charity Service

The “Change Charity Service” means the Change Charity application (the “App”) and its associated features and services, including without limitation the changecharity.io website operated by Company. The Change Charity Service provides an online platform to virtually “round up” the user’s debit or credit card transactions and use this “spare change” to make tax-deductible donations to the registered non-profit of their choice. Users may change or terminate their designated charity and bank at any time, using the Change Charity Service’s functionality. All banking information is encrypted and stored on secure, bank approved, third party servers.

Eligibility to Use the Change Charity Service

Minors. You may only use the Change Charity Service if you are at least 18 years old. If you are younger than 18 years old you should leave the Change Charity Service immediately.

Agent of a Company, Entity, or Organization. If you are using the Change Charity Service on behalf of a company, entity, or organization (collectively “Organization”), then you represent and warrant that you:

are an authorized representative of that Organization;

have the authority to bind that Organization to these Terms; and

agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of that Organization.

Your Account

You represent and warrant that the information you provide to Company upon the signing up to the Change Charity Service and at all other times will be true, accurate, current, and complete.

Donations and Payments

Donations. Every day or two, Company will charge your designated bank account for the amount of your total rounded up change, but in any event no less than US$0.50(50 US cents). For clarity, you understand and acknowledge that your designated charity will receive approximately the amount of your donation, less the cost of our third party payment processing and the costs of our operations, marketing, and technology (collectively referred to as “transaction fees”).
Transaction fees are calculated as 3% of donated amount.

Minimum. The minimum donation for charities through Change Charity is $.50.

Designation of Funds. These donations will be designated as “Unrestricted Funds” for the nonprofit, unless otherwise stated by the nonprofit on the charity selection page.

Payments. The Change Charity Service currently uses third parties to process payments. Our third-party payment processors accept payments through various bank accounts, as detailed on the applicable payment screen.

United States Dollars. All monetary transactions on the Change Charity Service take place in
U.S. dollars.

Cancellation Terms. Your donations reoccur automatically until you cancel your subscription. You may cancel a subscription at any time by using the App’s functionality,

and your cancellation will be effective immediately.

Refunds.  If you believe any charge was incorrectly made to your credit or debit card, you must contact us to seek resolution. If we determine that a charge is in error, we will issue a refund in the amount of the charge in dispute, less the transaction fees, which are non-refundable.
